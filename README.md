# Recruitment AI

This repository now contains a starter [Streamlit](https://streamlit.io/) project for exploring recruitment workflows.

## Getting started

1. Create a virtual environment (Python 3.9+ recommended):
   ```bash
   python -m venv .venv
   ```
2. Activate the virtual environment:
   ```bash
   # Linux or macOS
   source .venv/bin/activate

   # Windows (PowerShell)
   .venv\\Scripts\\Activate.ps1
   ```
3. Install the dependencies inside the virtual environment:
   ```bash
   pip install --upgrade pip
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
4. Run the Streamlit development server:
   ```bash
   streamlit run app.py
   ```
5. Open the URL displayed in the terminal (typically `http://localhost:8501`).

## Project structure

- `app.py` &mdash; main Streamlit application entry point.
- `requirements.txt` &mdash; Python dependencies for the app.

Feel free to extend the widgets and integrate your own AI-powered recruitment workflows.
